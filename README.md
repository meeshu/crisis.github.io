# Visualizing Syrian Refugee Crisis 
To escape the violence of Syrian Civil War, more than four million Syrian refugees have fled the country to neighboring Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq, while thousands have also ended up in more distant countries of the Caucasus, the Persian Gulf, North Africa and Europe. At the present time, the Syrian Refugee Crisis is the world’s largest humanitarian crisis since the second world war.
This 4 member group class project done in Information Visualization course at Georgia Tech aimed at visualizing:
The escalation of the Syrian civil war over time and how it affects the number of Syrian refugees
The migration of Syrian refugees into different countries.
Highlighting individual refugee stories to explore the human aspect of the crisis.
Visualizing the number of violent events over time along with the geographical location of occurrence.
